 Noble Price Winning American Economist Harry Markowitz, designed a mathematical theory that encourages investing, by helping investors choose a diverse range of assets to build a portfolio but withing the range of their risk tolerance. Based on his theory, this Python Program :
1) compares the expected return of a portfolio with its standard deviation, or volatility.
